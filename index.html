                    <li>- Gained experience dealing with the 'Key Controller' and drawing components
                        in the JFrame,
                        including redrawing all components when the objects moved

                    <li>Using Java language and GUI Swing</li>
                    <li>Excellent attention to details and high level of accuracy in setting up
                        objects in the correct
                        positions because all objects need to have their proper X and Y coordinates
                        set within the
                        JFrame

                    <li>The potential project that I want to use for my second year project
                        assignment
                    </li>
                    <li>Using Java language, JavaFX, Scene Builder and Spring Boot JPA</li>
                    <li>When approaching JavaFX, it seemed easier for me because it is simple to
                        set the correct
                        positions for objects. Furthermore, I don't have to code a lot for the
                        layout, allowing me to
                        focus more on the logical organization and making the code more readable and
                        maintainable. Using a database with Spring JPA also makes everything easier
                        compared to the
                        old method (JDBC), which required many lines of code to set up. I expect to
                        complete this
                        project in 3 weeks.
